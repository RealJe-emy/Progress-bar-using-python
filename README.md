# Python Progress Bar using `tqdm`

This project demonstrates how to implement a progress bar in Python using the `tqdm` library. It includes two examples: one without a progress bar and another with a progress bar provided by `tqdm`.

---

## Features

- **Basic Example**: Simulates a time delay for each iteration without showing a progress bar.
- **Enhanced Example**: Uses `tqdm` to display a dynamic progress bar during iteration.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later.
- `tqdm` package installed.

To install the required package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install tqdm
